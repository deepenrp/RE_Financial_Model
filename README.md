# Wealth Creation through Real Estate

![Wealth Creation](static/images/real_estate.jpg)


## Background

As a mortgage loan originator, it is my responsibility to help home buyers understand leverage. As in how can leveraging a mortgage to buy a house help in wealth creation. After all, no one wants hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Is buying with cash better than with a mortgage? There are plenty of questions that needs to be answered. Questions even pop up after settlement. 

There are paid services that help home buyers understand wealth creation while utilizing a mortgage. After speaking to many home buyers, there was still a lack of access to this knowledge. I even had someone tell me that he wished his mortgage lender showed him this when he was getting a mortgage.

At that time, the various calculations I was doing were all done in Excel. I needed to put this on the web so that anyone with internet can have access to it. A preview of the Excel workbook is included in this repository. The webapp launched on Heroku is an easier way to understand wealth creation through home ownership. 

## 3 Ways
When we think about how we are creating wealth through real estate, there are 3 ways that work together simultaneously:
  * Equity Through Amortization
  * Housing Appreciation
  * Tax Benefits. 
  

Rather than looking at rows and columns of numbers, visualizing how the numbers work together can be very helpful in understanding how to build wealth through real estate.

Note:- Certain aspects of the model are included in Excel and not in the webapp. For example, modeling in private mortgage insurance or rent growth.
