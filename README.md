# Wealth Creation through Real Estate

![Wealth Creation](static/images/real_estate.jpg)


When we think about how we are creating wealth through real estate, there are 3 ways that work together simultaneously:
  * Equity Through Amortization
  * Housing Appreciation
  * Tax Benefits. 
  
Rather than looking at rows and columns of numbers, visualizing how the numbers work together can be very helpful in understanding how to build wealth through real estate.


Note:- Certain aspects of the model are included in Excel and not in the webapp. For example, modeling in private mortgage insurance or rent growth.

This repository is a work in progress and is in constant improvement.
