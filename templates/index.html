                <h6><strong><u>Equity Through Amortization</u></strong></h6>
                <p>Equity through Amortization is simply the home equity that is determined by 
                  taking the difference in the purchase price of the house and the loan balance 
                  of the mortgage. As you make your monthly mortgage payment, part of each payment 
                  is the principal payment that lowers the principal balance or loan balance converting
                  principal into equity. In a sense, this is a forced savings plan. On the left is what your 
                  Amortization Chart will look like based on the $412,284 Purchase Price with 20% down 
                  payment ($329,827 Loan Amount).

                <h6><strong><u>Equity Through Appreciation</u></strong></h6>
                <p>Housing Appreciation is the increase in value of your house. Determining this can be tricky 
                  so I suggest speaking to your Realtor every year or two and get a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). 
                  This can help us determine the rate of appreciation of your house more accurately as well as how much 
                  wealth is created by simply increase in house value. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and 
                  its House Price Index for New Jersey, average housing appreciation is 3.425% per year over the past 5 years. 
                  The chart on the right shows how much wealth can be created if this rate of appreciation continues in the future.

                <h6><strong><u>Tax Benefits</u></strong></h6>
                <p>There may or may not be Tax Benefits for paying interest and property taxes on a house. It all depends on your 
                  tax bracket and how you are filing your taxes. To learn about any tax benefits for owning a house, 
                  please consult with your Tax Accountant.

                <h6><strong><u>How Much Wealth Can Be Created?</u></strong></h6>
                <p>There are 3 major decisions that have a huge impact on our long-term financial well-being:  
                  Going to College, Buying a Car, and Buying a House. Obviously, we cannot predict the future but like 
                  any kind of investment we can determine the risks and make a calculated move. In this section we can look at 
                  an example scenario to put a dollar amount on the wealth that can be created. If you would like me to run a 
                  different scenario for you then I am more than happy to do that.

                <h6><strong><u>Net Wealth Created</u></strong></h6>
                <p>As we discussed on earlier that there are 3 ways to gain wealth through homeownership. I do not want to speculate 
                  on the tax benefits but bringing the numbers for Equity through Amortization, House Appreciation as well as the 
                  difference in monthly housing payments between owning and renting together, we can see how much wealth is created 
                  over the first 10 years in the chart on the right.
                </p> 
                <p>When taking all assumptions into account, the difference in Cash Flows between buying and renting, the gain in Equity 
                  through Amortization as well as Appreciation we can determine the dollar amount attributed to the amount of wealth 
                  created through owning the house. The chart projects the next 10 years of wealth creation.
